## NFTs
An NFT, or Non-Fungible Token, is a type of digital asset that represents ownership or proof of authenticity of a unique item or piece of content, typically stored on a blockchain, often the Ethereum blockchain. Unlike cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin or Ethereum, which are fungible and can be exchanged on a one-to-one basis, NFTs are unique and cannot be exchanged on a like-for-like basis.

Here's a breakdown in simpler terms:

Digital Ownership: NFTs certify ownership or proof of authenticity of digital items like artwork, videos, music, virtual real estate, in-game items, tweets, and more.

Uniqueness: Each NFT is distinct and cannot be replicated. It's like having a unique collector's item or a rare trading card in the digital world.

Blockchain: NFTs are typically stored on a blockchain, often Ethereum, which provides a transparent and secure way to verify ownership and authenticity.

Interoperability: NFTs can be bought, sold, and traded on various online marketplaces, allowing creators to monetize their digital creations and collectors to buy and sell them.

Smart Contracts: NFTs often utilize smart contracts, which are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement directly written into code. These smart contracts facilitate transactions and ensure that ownership rights are transferred securely and automatically.

In essence, NFTs have gained popularity because they enable digital creators to monetize their work in new ways and allow collectors to own and trade unique digital assets in a decentralized and transparent manner.

## ERC721
ERC-721 is another standard for tokens on the Ethereum blockchain, but unlike ERC-20 tokens which are fungible (interchangeable), ERC-721 tokens are non-fungible tokens (NFTs), meaning each token is unique and cannot be exchanged on a like-for-like basis. The ERC-721 standard defines a set of rules and functionalities for creating and managing NFTs. Here are some of the key methods typically associated with ERC-721 tokens:

totalSupply: Returns the total number of tokens in existence within a particular ERC-721 contract.

balanceOf: Allows querying the balance of a specific Ethereum address to determine how many ERC-721 tokens it owns.

ownerOf: Given the unique token identifier (ID), this method returns the Ethereum address of the current owner of that specific token.

approve: Enables an owner to give permission to another Ethereum address to transfer a specific token on their behalf.

getApproved: Retrieves the address approved to transfer a specific token on behalf of the owner.

setApprovalForAll: Allows an owner to approve or revoke permission for another address to transfer any of the owner's tokens on their behalf.

isApprovedForAll: Checks if an address has been granted permission to transfer any tokens on behalf of the owner.

transferFrom: Transfers ownership of a specific token from one address to another, provided the sender has been approved by the current owner.

safeTransferFrom: Similar to transferFrom, but includes an additional check to ensure the recipient is capable of receiving ERC-721 tokens.

These methods provide the basic functionalities required to create, manage, and transfer non-fungible tokens according to the ERC-721 standard. Developers can use these methods to build various applications, including digital art marketplaces, gaming platforms, collectible exchanges, and more.
